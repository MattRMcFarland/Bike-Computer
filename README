Author: Matt McFarland and Josh Lang

This Bike Computer project was created as final project
for a digital circuits design course during the summer of 
2014 at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College.

The bike computer was constructed out of a Xilinx FPGA which was
configured using VHDL.
